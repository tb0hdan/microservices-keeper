*microservices-keeper* is a tool to keep track of Code Change Decisions [CCD] as part of microservices maintenance.
I've coined up this term after reading Michael Nygard's article - see [About](#about).
Basically, it's works with git repository as a form of centralized storage,
where all necessary changes get committed so the developer can walk through
the list and confirm that code edits have been made. Work in progress.
